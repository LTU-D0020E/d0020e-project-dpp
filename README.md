This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Downloading dependencies:

```bash
npm i
# or
npm install
```

Adding necessary files:
add a file called env.local inside src/ and add correct environment variables.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/something](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/something). As mentioned before pages/api will take the relative url to perform API calls

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


##Additional Information

This project has been using MongoDB for data storage. You will have to create a new MongoDB database and add the URI to the env.local (DO NOT STORE THOSE STRINGS IN env.example).
